# Ecommerce_django
Django ecommerce
This project is a full-stack fully fledged django e-commerce platform, with basic JS for cart functionality, as well as blog functionality with comments e.t.c 
I recently changed the entire front-end and inspired by  a template I got from colorlib that has a stunning design, with some Amazing Javascript and CSS. 
The project also has a sort of CRM built into it in the url /admin-home/, where you can manage blog posts add delete comments and reviews, add remove and edit products, e.t.c
